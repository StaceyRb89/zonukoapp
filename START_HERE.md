## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Customize Skill Points**: Different projects can emphasize different skills. Edit `ProjectSkillMapping` in admin.

2. **Monitor Reflection Rate**: Track how many children provide reflections. High rate = engaged learners.

3. **Celebrate Milestones**: Stages are great for celebration. Recognize when children reach new stages.

4. **Use for Recommendations**: Look at which pathways each child excels at. Recommend related projects.

5. **Share with Parents**: Parents can see their child's growth path. It's transparent and meaningful.

---

## 🎓 TEACHING TIPS

**Tell Children:**
"Your growth map shows how you're getting better at different skills. No points, no pressure—just real growth. The more you reflect, the faster you grow."

**Tell Parents:**
"We track 6 dimensions of creative growth. This shows us which skills your child is developing through making projects."

**Tell Teachers:**
"Use the growth map to identify which pathways each child excels at, and recommend projects accordingly."

---

## 📞 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: How long until a child levels up?**
A: Typically 5-8 projects to reach Level 2, then more as you go higher. This encourages sustained engagement.

**Q: Can children see other children's progress?**
A: No. Each child has their own private growth map. The system is non-competitive.

**Q: What if a project has no skill mapping?**
A: Default values are used (30 making, 20 thinking, 20 problem-solving, etc.). You can customize anytime.

**Q: Will this work on mobile?**
A: Yes! All templates are fully responsive. Tested and optimized for mobile devices.

**Q: Can parents see progression?**
A: Currently parents see their child's profile. A full parent dashboard is planned for v1.1.

**Q: How do I change the reflection bonus?**
A: Edit the `add_points()` method in `GrowthPathway` model. Change `points * 0.25` to your desired percentage.
