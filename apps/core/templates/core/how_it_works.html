            <h1>How Zonuko works (for parents)</h1>
            <p class="lead">A calm weekly rhythm of hands-on projects — with clear guidance on when adult support is recommended, and parent-controlled sharing.</p>
            <p>Screen use is purposeful (planning, creating, reflecting) — not passive watching.</p>

            <p>Zonuko is designed to be easy to start and easy to stick with — even on busy weeks.</p>

                <h3>1. Pick a project</h3>
                <p>Choose from a small set of weekly projects matched to your child’s age track (Imaginauts 6–10, Navigators 11–13, Trailblazers 14–16).</p>

                <h3>2. Build offline (with clear guidance)</h3>
                <p>Kids spend most of their time making with everyday materials. Each project includes simple setup notes and clearly flags when adult support or supervision is recommended.</p>

                <h3>3. Capture progress (optional)</h3>
                <p>Your child can save a photo and a short reflection to their private portfolio. Sharing is always optional and only happens with parent approval.</p>
